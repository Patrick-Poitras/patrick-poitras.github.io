Hey, is this thing on?

Welcome to my empire of ramblings! It has a nice color scheme that is stolen from [my emacs port](https://github.com/Patrick-Poitras/emacs-material-ocean) of the extra material color themes for VSCode. Shameless plug.

The template was taken from [this theme](https://github.com/tocttou/hacker-blog) by [Ashish Chaudhary](https://github.com/tocttou), I contributed the color palette and the unhinged takes that are about to be posted here.
