Hello!

I am Patrick Poitras. My interests are varied but the common thread is "weird tech stuff". I have an M.Sc. in Physics, and am employed as a software developer, doing systems programming at D-Wave.

If you need to contact me, try reaching out via email, at patrick.f.poitras [at] gmail.com, or [on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@pfpoitras).
